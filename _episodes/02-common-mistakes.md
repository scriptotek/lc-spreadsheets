## Multiple tables {#tables}

A common strategy is creating multiple data tables within one
spreadsheet. This is examplified in the figure below:

![multiple tabs](../fig/2_datasheet_example.jpg)

Although it is often useful to have many tables on the same spreadsheet by making the tables more accessible and simpler to visually compare, mentally group them, etc., it leads to difficulties in exporting to other formats such as csv. You will have to put each table into its own sheet (and as a seperate issue clean up the data) and export each sheet into its own csv-file. The example above depicts a typical visualization of data for reports etc, and isn't very practical to be doing analyses on.

## Multiple sheets {#sheets}

It is not easy to categorically state when it is beneficial to keep the data in one sheet, and when to split the data into separate sheets. A general rule could be to **put data that with the same columns** in the same sheet, and **only create a new sheet if the new data has a different set of columns**, i.e. **structure**. For example, if you do the same survey on library user behavior every year, it is better to keep all the data in the same sheet and not make a new one for each year: This makes it easier to compare data across years.  
But what happens if you add one question (say for age) which gives you an extra column? Should you then make a new sheet for the new data? Well, no. Just add the new column to existing sheet. Excel (and other programs) have ways of dealing with **missing data**, and you get the benefit of being able to compare the rest of the old data with the new in the same sheet.  
But what if you add two new questions, and maybe remove one, what then? Again, it is difficult to give a categorical answer, but if you see that the new data is **structurally too different**, i.e. have to many unshared columns, then you should place it in **a new sheet**.

## Header pollution {#freeze}
Sometimes the title headers of columns can get confused into the data analysis itself (for example sorting or summarizing). 
If you want to keep an overview of the column names in large datasets, you can freeze the column headers, so that they are visible at the top of thee screen no matter how far you scroll down.  

Here is a recipe:

[Documentation on how to freeze column headers](https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Freeze-column-headings-for-easy-scrolling-57ccce0c-cf85-4725-9579-c5d13106ca6a)


## Zero vs null {#zerovsnull}

It might be that when you're measuring something, it's a zero, say if a patron reports never having used a certain service.
If this happens often and you get a lot of zeroes, why bother writing in the number zero in that column, when it's mostly zeros?

However, there's a difference between a zero and a blank cell in a spreadsheet. To the computer, a zero is actually data. You measured or counted it. A blank cell means that it wasn't measured and the computer will interpret it as a **null** value. A null value really means "nobody knows" to a computer, equivalent to leaving out data, which is very different from knowing that something has a specific value of zero. If you use blanks for zeroes or zeroes for blanks it will cause all sorts of problems for your analyses.
Most spreadsheet programs accept a completely empty cell as null, so if you have no data, **leave the cell empty!**  


## Using formatting to convey information  {#formatting}

**Example**: Highlighting cells, rows or columns that should be excluded from an analysis.

![formatting](../fig/02-common-mistakes_formatting.png)

**Solution**: Create a new field (Cancelled) to mark the data to exclude.

## Using formatting to make the data sheet look pretty {#formatting_pretty}

**Example**: Merged cells. If you’re not careful, formatting a worksheet to be more aesthetically pleasing can compromise the spreadsheet program's ability to preform analyses. In the example below, the spreadsheet program would not be able to sort the 'Due Date' column because of empty cells.

![merged cells](../fig/02-common-mistakes_merging.png)

**Solution**:  Make sure to not have empty cells if you actually have data for those cells (see null values above) and avoid merging cells with similar value.


## Placing comments or units in cells {#units}

**Example**: You have an uncertain date for training course data marked with a question mark, like  this 02.06.20167?

**Solution**: Spreadsheet programs (like Excel), unlike humans, do not understand that by placing a question mark at the end of a value specifies that the value is uncertain. As described above for formatting, create another field if you need to add notes to cells. Similarly, don’t include units in cells, for example if you have a column for hours, don't put in "1,5h" or "1,5 hours". Also make sure that the measurements you place in one column are of the same unit, i.e. don't enter minutes in a column specified for hours. 


## More than one piece of information in a cell {#info}

**Example**: You find one male, and one female of the same species. You enter this as 1M, 1F.

**Solution**: Never include more than one piece of information in a cell. If you need both these measurements, design your data sheet to include this information.


## Field name problems {#field_name}
Choose descriptive field names, but be careful not to include: spaces, numbers, or special characters of any kind. Spaces can be misinterpreted by parsers that use whitespace as delimiters and some programs don’t like field names that are text strings that start with numbers.
Underscores (`_`) are a good alternative to spaces and consider writing names in camel-case to improve readability. Remember that abbreviations that make sense at the moment may not be so obvious in 6 months but don't overdo it with names that are excessively long. Including the units in the field names avoids confusion and enables others to readily interpret your fields.

**Examples**  

| Good Name          | Good Alternative   | Avoid                |
|--------------------+--------------------+----------------------|
| Max\_temp\_C       | MaxTemp            | Maximum Temp (°C)    |
| Precipitation\_mm  | Precipitation      | precmm               |
| Mean\_year\_growth | MeanYearGrowth     | Mean growth/year	 |
| sex                | sex                | M/F                  |
| weight             | weight             | w.                   |
| cell\_type         | CellType           | Cell Type            |
| Observation\_01    | first\_observation | 1st Obs              |


## Special characters in data {#special}

**Example**: You treat Excel as a word processor when writing notes, even copying data directly from Word or other applications.

**Solution**: This is a common strategy. For example, when writing longer text in a cell, people often include line breaks, em-dashes, et al in their spreadsheet.  Worse yet, when copying data in from applications such as Word, formatting and fancy non-standard characters (such as left- and right-aligned quotation marks) are included.  When exporting this data into a coding/statistical environment or into a relational database, dangerous things may occur, such as lines being cut in half and encoding errors being thrown.

General best practice is to avoid adding characters such as newlines, tabs, and vertical tabs.  In other words, treat a text cell as if it were a simple web form that can only contain text and spaces.


## Inclusion of metadata in data table {#metadata}

**Example**: You add a legend at the top or bottom of your data table explaining column meaning, units, exceptions, etc.

**Solution**: While recording data about your data ("metadata") is essential, this information should not be contained in the data file itself. Unlike a table in a paper or a supplemental file, metadata (in the form of legends) should not be included in a data file since this information is not data, and including it can disrupt how computer programs interpret your data file. Rather, metadata should be stored as a separate file in the same directory as your data file, preferably in plain text format with a name that clearly associates it with your data file. Because metadata files are free text format, they also allow you to encode comments, units, information about how null values are encoded, etc. that are important to document but can disrupt the formatting of your data file.
