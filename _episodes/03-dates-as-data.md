Dates can be written in numerous ways, both with or without letters, punctuation, dashes, slashes, abbreviations, space etc.
Of course, although modern spreadsheet programs are quite clever at understanding different ways of writing dates, not all of these formats will be interpreded correctly.

## Data formats in spreadsheets

Spreadsheet programs have numerous “useful features” which allow them to “handle” dates in a variety of ways.

![Many formats, many ambiguities](../fig/5_excel_dates_1.jpg)

But these ‘features’ often allow ambiguity to creep into your data. Ideally, data should be as unambiguous as possible. 

### Properly formatting dates

It is important to make sure that the dates you enter are understood by the spreadsheet program. A nice approach is to format the column in the date format you want before you start entering dates. In Excel you can do this by selecting the entire column (click on the "letter" header of the column i.e. "A"), then right click and choose "Format cells". Chose "Date", and find the format you want from the list, for example "dd.mm.yyyy". Now, even if you write "14. jul", "14-jul", etc, if Excel understands what you write as a date it will convert it into the format you've chosen. If Excel doesn't understand what you write, it will not format your date and you immediately see that it is poorly written.

### Several columns for dates

Most spreadsheets have dates stored in one column. Ususally spreadsheet programs offer ways of extracting parts from a date as long as it is formatted properly. But, please remember that functions that are valid for a given spreadsheet program (be it LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org, Gnumeric, etc.) are usually guaranteed to be compatible only within the same
family of products. 

Let's try with a simple challenge.

## Preferred date format

Instead it is much safer to store dates with [MONTH, DAY and YEAR](#day) in separate columns or as [YEAR and DAY-OF-YEAR](#doy) in separate columns.

> ## Note
> 
> Excel is unable to parse dates from before 1899-12-31, and will thus leave these untouched.  If you’re mixing historic data from before and after this date, Excel will translate only the post-1900 dates into its internal format, thus resulting in mixed data.  If you’re working with historic data, be extremely careful with your dates!
> Excel also entertains a second date system, the 1904 date system, as the default in Excel for Macintosh. This system will assign a different serial number than the [1900 date system](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/180162). Because of this, [dates must be checked for accuracy when exporting data from Excel](http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/04/10/abandon-all-hope-ye-who-enter-dates-in-excel/) (look for dates that are ~4 years off).

## Advantages of Alternative Date Formatting ##

### Storing dates as YEAR, MONTH, DAY {#day}

Storing dates in YEAR, MONTH, DAY format helps remove this ambiguity. Let's look at this issue a bit closer.

For instance this is a spreadsheet representing insect counts that were taken every few days over the summer, and things went something like this:

![So, so ambiguous, it's even confusing Excel](../fig/6_excel_dates_2.jpg)


If Excel was to be believed, this person had been collecting bugs IN THE FUTURE. Now, we have no doubt this person is highly capable, but I believe time travel was beyond even his grasp.

Entering dates in one cell is helpful but due to the fact that the spreadsheet programmes may interpret and save the data in different ways (doing that somewhat behind the scenes), there is a better practice.

In dealing with dates in spreadsheets, we recommend separating **date data into separate fields** (day, month, year), which will eliminate any chance of ambiguity. 

### Storing dates as YEAR, DAY-OF-YEAR {#doy}

There is also another option:  
You can also store dates as year, and day of year (DOY). Why? Because depending on your
question, this might be what's useful to you, and there is practically no possibility for ambiguity creeping in.

Statistical models often incorporate year as a factor, to account for year-to-year variation, and DOY can be used to measure the passage of time within a year. 

So, can you convert all your dates into DOY format? Well, in Excel, here’s a handy dandy guide:

![Kill that ambiguity before it bites you!](../fig/7_excel_dates_3.jpg)

### Storing dates as a single string {#str}

Another alternative could be to convert the date string
into a single string using the `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` format.
For example the date `March 24, 2015 17:25:35` would
become `20150324172535`, where:

```
YYYY:   the full year, i.e. 2015
MM:     the month, i.e. 03
DD:     the day of month, i.e. 24
hh:     hour of day, i.e. 17
mm:     minutes, i.e. 25
ss:     seconds, i.e. 35
```

Such strings will be correctly sorted in ascendng or descending order, and by
knowing the format they can then be correctly processed by the receiving
software.
