Spreadsheet usage is often useful and neccessary for librarians. We can use them for:

- Viewing data
- Storing data
- Organizing data (categorizing and sorting)
- Visualizing data (charts and graphs)
- Importing and exporting data

### What these lesson will not teach you

- How to do *plotting* i.e. charts and graphs in a spreadsheet
- How to *write code* i.e. formulas and macros in spreadsheet programs
- How to do *statistics* in a spreadsheet

These topics are outside of the scope of this lesson, if you're looking to do this, a good reference is

### Spreadsheet programs

Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general idea
is the same.

- LibreOffice
- Microsoft Excel
- Gnumeric
- OpenOffice.org

In this lesson, we will assume that you are most likely using Excel as
your primary spreadsheet program - there are others (gnumeric, Calc
from OpenOffice), and their functionality is similar, but Excel is the
package you're most likely to have available on your work computer.
A few of the menu commands we use are excel specific, so bear that in mind if you aim
to use another spreadsheet program. We will indicate these in the lesson 
material as far as we are aware of them.

## Common usages and problems with spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are very useful for **data entry**, and **viewing data.**
**Importing and exporting data** with spreadsheet programs is commonly routine
in many libraries, and often the data needs to be **tidied up** before export or after import.

Problems often arise when spreadsheets are used for generating **tables for reports** that are
made for readability. Colors are used, border are added, cells are merged 
and tables are spilt up. Changes like these are not only cosmetic, they
**can make it difficult or downright impossible** to do future work with the data,
such as sorting and summarizing.

A good routine is to keep the original data separate from the prettified data,
for example having two sheets, one with the table of original data, and one sheet with
the table of prettified data:

<kbd>![alt text](/lc-spreadsheets/fig/00-intro_raw_data.png "Original (raw) data in Excel table")</kbd> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd><![alt text](/lc-spreadsheets/fig/00-intro_pretty_data.png "Prettified data in Excel table")</kbd>

Optionally you can use word processors like Word to make pretty tables and use Excel for organizing the data.

We also recommend that you keep track of important things you did to the original data in a separate sheet, for example noting if you found some great recipe for tidying up some data or if you reorganized the data in an complex or major way.
